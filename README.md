1. What is Shell Scripting?
A shell script is a file containing a series of commands that are executed by the shell (command-line interpreter). These scripts can automate repetitive tasks, manage system operations, and perform complex sequences of commands.

2. Basic Shell Script Structure
A basic shell script typically includes:

Shebang Line: The first line of the script specifies the interpreter to be used. For example, for Bash, itâ€™s:

sh
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
Commands: The rest of the script contains commands and logic to be executed.

Example:

sh
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello, World!"
3. Basic Shell Scripting Concepts
Variables
Declaration: You can create variables and assign values. No spaces around the = sign.

sh
Copy code
my_variable="Hello"
Usage: Access variables with the $ sign.

sh
Copy code
echo $my_variable
Comments
Single-line comments: Use # for comments.

sh
Copy code
# This is a comment
echo "This is a command"
Multi-line comments: Shell scripting does not have a specific syntax for multi-line comments, but you can use : ' ... ' or << 'COMMENT' ... COMMENT to mimic them.

Control Structures
Conditionals: Use if, then, elif, and else for conditional execution.

sh
Copy code
if [ condition ]; then
  # commands
elif [ other_condition ]; then
  # other commands
else
  # fallback commands
fi
Example:

sh
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
if [ "$1" -gt 10 ]; then
  echo "Number is greater than 10"
else
  echo "Number is 10 or less"
fi
Loops: Use for, while, and until for looping.

For loop:

sh
Copy code
for i in {1..5}; do
  echo "Number $i"
done
While loop:

sh
Copy code
count=1
while [ $count -le 5 ]; do
  echo "Count $count"
  ((count++))
done
Until loop:

sh
Copy code
count=1
until [ $count -gt 5 ]; do
  echo "Count $count"
  ((count++))
done
Functions
Definition and Usage: Define functions to organize code and reuse it.
sh
Copy code
my_function() {
  echo "Hello from the function!"
}

my_function  # Call the function
4. Input and Output
Reading Input: Use read to get user input.

sh
Copy code
echo "Enter your name:"
read name
echo "Hello, $name!"
Redirecting Output: Use > to redirect output to a file or >> to append.

sh
echo "This is a test" > output.txt
echo "This will be appended" >> output.txt
Piping: Use | to pass the output of one command as input to another.

sh
ls -l | grep "filename"
5. File Permissions
Make Script Executable: Use chmod to change permissions and make your script executable.

sh

chmod +x myscript.sh
Execute the Script: Run the script by prefixing it with ./.

sh

./myscript.sh
Error Handling
Exit Status: Every command returns an exit status ($?). A status of 0 indicates success, and anything else indicates an error.
sh
Copy code
command
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Command succeeded"
else
  echo "Command failed"
fi
